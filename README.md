## Introduction

Programming paradigms are different approaches to writing code, each with its own set of principles and concepts. This repository showcases three programming paradigms used to create a basic calculator program. The goal is to provide insights into how the same functionality can be implemented using different programming styles.

## Program Versions

1. **Imperative**: This version of the calculator program uses traditional control structures like loops and conditionals for logic flow.

2. **Functional**: The functional version employs concepts like pure functions, immutability, and higher-order functions to perform calculations.

3. **Object-Oriented**: In the object-oriented version, the calculator's functionality is encapsulated within classes, allowing for modular and organized code.

Each version provides the same core features, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/teaching-repositories/programming_paradigms


2. Navigate to the directory of the specific programming paradigm you want to explore:

    cd programming_paradigms/imperative

3. Run the calculator program using your preferred Python interpreter:

  python calculator.py


4. Follow the on-screen prompts to choose an operation and input operands. The program will display the result of the calculation.

5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the functional and object-oriented versions.

## Paradigm Overview

- **Imperative Paradigm**: Focuses on describing "how" to achieve a task using explicit instructions and control structures.

- **Functional Paradigm**: Emphasises "what" needs to be done by composing functions and avoiding side effects. It relies on immutability and higher-order functions.

- **Object-Oriented Paradigm**: Organises code around objects that encapsulate data and behaviour. It promotes modularity and reusability through classes and inheritance.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to enhance or expand the calculator program for any of the paradigms, feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
